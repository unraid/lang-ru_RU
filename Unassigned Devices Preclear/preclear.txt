You can use Unassigned Devices to clear the disk=

:preclear_general_help_plug:
> The Unassigned Devices Preclear can be used to prepare disks for inclusion in the array, clear disks for disposal, and perform stress tests before disks are used in the array.
>
> Only disks that are not being used in the array and have no partitions with file systems will be listed as candidates for preclearing.
>
> When a disk is being precleared, you can follow the status on this page, on the Unassigned Devices page, or the preclear status icon in the footer of the Unraid web page.
> 
> There are multiple choices for preclearing:
>
> The **Enhanced** script authored by user **gfjardim** has the advantage that it supports the enhanced features like pause and resume preclearing.  It also has extensive logging.
>
> The **Docker** is the binhex Docker container that performs preclear.  The advantage of this is the preclearing is isolated in the Docker container.
>
> Preclear operations:
>
> + Clear Disk - The disk is cleared and the Unraid signature is written to the disk.  This will create an empty partition on the disk.
> + Erase Disk - Erase the entire disk by writing all zeros.  The preclear signature is removed.
> + Erase and Clear Disk - random patterns are written to the disk and then zeroes are written.  This is a good choice for a disk to be discarded to ensure all traces of files are removed.
> + Verify Signature - The disk signature is checked.
> + Verify Disk - The disk signature is checked and the disk is verified to be zeroed.
> + Post-read Verify - Perform a post read verify to check the disk.
> + Clear Signature - Remove the preclear signature from the disk.
>
> The text <em style='color:#00BE37;'>Precleared</em> next to the disk serial number indicates that the disk has a precleared signature.  This will only show when the disk is precleared and the Preclear Stats have been removed.
